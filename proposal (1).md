# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive storybook that allows the user to choose their own path. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will serve as entertainment and allow the user to interact. The book will follow a storyline about a simulated first day of school and the user can choose the fate of their day. Similar to a picture book, each question will have an image accompanied with it. The user will type in either yes or no, and the next image will come up and prompt the user again until the end of the story. This will be executed using a while loop. The while loop will continue until the user has landed on the last page and inputs “end”. The pages will flip through using an if else elif loop. The images will be saved files that are opened and closed throughout the book. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will write a code that properly prompts the user with yes and no questions and creates a coherent storyline. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will write a code that properly prompts the user with images accompanied to yes and no questions and creates a coherent storyline.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to create a choose your own path storybook. I hope to have three different potential story lines, allow the user the option to play again at the end of the project, and to restart within the middle of the game if they decide to do so. I also hope to have images accompanied with each choice, so the game closely resembles a picturebook. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step is to conceptualize the three different paths that I will allow my user to take and the outcome of each of the inputs. I will execute this by creating a concept map and visually organize where I want my code to proceed next. After the three different possibilites are written, I will need to draw each image that I want to project every step of the way throughout the project. I hope to draw these on my ipad and save them as files on my laptop and call them along with user input. I will need to research how to properly open and close these images through every step of the way. The entire code will be based on a while loop, and will break once the user reaches the last page and does not opt to play again. The different steps of the game will be coded through an if else elif loop.
